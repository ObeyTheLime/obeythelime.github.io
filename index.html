                        <p>Our guild was established in 2012 with the purpose of building a close-knit gaming community that caters to the busy adult. We understand that life comes first and have no mandatory events or time commitments. We believe in the power of respect and look for supportive members who value teamwork. Elitism and aggression are not tolerated here; we work together to achieve our goals. While we are based out of North America, we accept players from all over the globe and embrace diversity. We are always looking for committed, social players who enjoy all aspects of multiplayer gaming in a more casual, semi-competitive environment.</p>

                    <h2>Recruitment<span class="subtitle-dot">.</span></h2>

                        <p>Community is our number one focus here at Tonic, so we recruit slowly and carefully with interviews for each potential new Lime. While our members play many different types of games together, we only are accepting <a href="http://guildwars2.com">Guild Wars 2</a> players at this time. We want new recruits who align well with our mission (above) and can follow our code of conduct (below). Our aim is to have a small, close group of people that actively plays and interacts socially with each other. We expect to be your "main squeeze" when it comes to guild representation (>90%), as we have found this to put more emphasis on loyalty to our community. For more information, or to request an interview, please contact Thix by <a href="mailto:&#116;&#104;&#105;&#120;&#064;&#111;&#098;&#101;&#121;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#108;&#105;&#109;&#101;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">email</a> or inside Guild Wars 2 at <b>sinthetix.8765</b>.</p> 

	  				<h2>Code of Conduct<span class="subtitle-dot">.</span></h2>

    	  				<p>Tonic is a mature-oriented community for adults where everyone is welcome to become a Lime. However, being in Tonic may not be for everyone as our culture often includes swearing, intoxication, and sex-positive themes. Potential members uncomfortable with any of these concepts are advised not to join our community. While our subject matters are adult, we also expect all members to behave like respectful adults; harassment or discrimination is not tolerated in any form.</p>

                        <p><i>While being a member of Tonic, you agree to represent our guild in a positive manner and treat both our members and the community at large with respect, honor, and integrity.</i></p>

                        <p>We will not allow offensive language regarding gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, chronic illness, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. Any conversations regarding sensual/sexual topics must remain consent-positive and respect personal boundaries set by each individual member of the community. Bullying, threats of assault, and unwanted sexual advances are considered major violations to this code and offenders will be removed immediately.</p>

                        <p>Behavior such as game exploiting, griefing, spawn camping, stealing/ninjaing loot, unwarranted kicking from parties, spamming chat, and harassing members outside of our community is deemed detrimental to Tonic's reputation and is a violation of both our mission and code of conduct.</p>

                        <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact <a href="mailto:&#116;&#104;&#105;&#120;&#064;&#111;&#098;&#101;&#121;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#108;&#105;&#109;&#101;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">Thix</a> (the guild leader) or any officer of our community. If a person is asked to stop any offending behavior, they are expected to comply and discontinue immediately. A person found repeatedly or purposefully violating our policies will be permanently banned from the community.</p>
